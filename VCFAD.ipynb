    "The final trained model was able to achieve 99% precision, recall and F1 score on the test set. In detail only two fake sample are misclassified as real and 12 real samples are classified as fake. The performance are exceptional for this particular case but bigger and complex dataset could require a more complex model. Also the method to create fake audio files could be improved with the fine-tuning of the pretrained xtts v2 model or different model could be considered."
