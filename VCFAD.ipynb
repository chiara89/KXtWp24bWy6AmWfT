    "The final trained model was able to achieve 99% precision, recall and F1 score on the test set. In detail only one fake sample is misclassified as real and 23 real samples are classified as fake. The performance are exceptional for this particular case but bigger and complex dataset could require a more complex model. Also the method to create fake audio files could be improved with the fine-tuning of the pretrained Tacotron2 model or different model could be considered."
